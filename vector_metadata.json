The PD-PFM Review focuses \non four key elements of the PFM system: legal and institutional foundations; \nbudget appropriation arrangements; financial management controls; and \nprocurement arrangements.1  \nFigure 1. Core modules of the PD-PFM Review\n1 - Development and application of the PD-PFM Review is supported with funding provided by Global \nAffairs Canada and is part of a larger World Bank executed Externally Financed Output (EFO) titled \nInclusive Economic Management in the Caribbean. This EFO is in place for three years (2017-2020) \nfor the benefit of selected Caribbean countries. A component of this EFO focuses on ensuring PFM \nprocesses and systems can respond effectively to increasingly frequent natural disasters that are \nassociated with worsening of climate change.

    "chunk_text": "The objective of the PD-PFM Review is to help countries assess the \ncapability of their PFM systems to respond to natural disasters by \nmeasuring the extent to which disaster-response considerations are \nintegrated into key PFM functions and activities. This assessment can be \nused to design, implement and evaluate reforms that seek to strengthen \ntheir capacity to manage public funds more efficiently and effectively in \npost-disaster situations. The PD-PFM Review has been developed and \ntested as part of a program to support resilience in selected Caribbean \ncountries: Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, \nJamaica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Suriname. The PD-PFM Review is designed to provide a quick and robust overview \nof the strengthens and weaknesses of a PFM system that may affect \ndisaster response and recovery efforts. The review is not an audit or a \ncomprehensive assessment of the PFM system. It does not substitute for \ndisaster risk or fiduciary assessments. Rather, the review is a standardized \ntool that countries can quickly apply, in a modular way if required, to pinpoint \nspecific elements of their PFM systems that could be refined to optimize \nthe allocation and execution of public resources to facilitate timely recovery \nfrom natural disasters. The modules of the PD-PFM Review can be applied \nseparately, allowing countries to assess their capability in specific areas. Successive PD-PFM Reviews over a number of years can be used to track \nthe progress of reforms and adjust their design to target weaknesses. The PD-PFM Review applies generally accepted principles of good \npublic financial management in the context of disaster response and \nrecovery. According to the Public Expenditure and Accountability (PEFA) \nprogram, the ‘purpose of a good PFM system is to ensure that the policies \nof governments are implemented as intended and achieve their objectives’. When a disaster occurs, the primary objective of government is typically to \nminimize loss and facilitate the recovery of affected areas and population as \nsoon as possible. Achievement of this objective requires a responsive and \norderly PFM system. The PD-PFM Review identifies eight core principles \nthat should guide the development of such a system. 6"

Appropriate public or external scrutiny, internal control, \nand robust review of service quality take place that hold public officials \naccountable for adherence to established standards and procedures when \nmaking and recording decisions and the consequences of their actions. Ȋ ►Efficiency. Resources are used to deliver timely, high-quality outcomes that \nrepresent fair value for money. Ȋ ►Flexibility. Fiscal rules, institutional frameworks, and administrative guidelines \ninclude clauses that allow timely and appropriate response to disasters. Ȋ ►Gender Sensitivity. Attention is paid—in the assessment, planning, and \nprogramming stages of recovery—to the differentiated roles and special \nproblems that women and men face in particularly difficult disaster-related \ncircumstances. Ȋ ►Reliability. Emergency financial protocols are executed consistently \nirrespective of the physical state of the government. Ȋ ►Resilience. Financial resources are used to restore, redevelop, and revitalize \nnatural and socioeconomic (including governance) environments so that they \nare better able to withstand the impacts of future disasters. Ȋ ►Responsiveness. Relevant PFM actors and processes are identified and \nstrategically sequenced to deliver targeted results in a timely and organized \nmanner with minimum delays and loss of opportunities.

Indicator M1.1 examines the extent to which \nlegislation and procedures specify what specific budgetary processes are \nprescribed in the context of disaster response, when these budgetary steps \nshould be taken, and who is responsible. Legislation should define the \nconditions in which these post-disaster rules should apply and for how long. Ȋ M1.2: Institutional arrangements for managing post-disaster financing. This indicator examines the extent to which institutional mechanisms are in \nplace to execute the financing of post-disaster relief and recovery operations \nin accordance with the legal and regulatory framework. During a state of \nemergency, clear, streamlined institutional mechanisms are needed to: enable \nthe transmission of data, information, and decisions between the finance \nministry and emergency response agencies; expedite approval processes and \nthe flow of funds; and ensure the appropriate use of mobilized resources. Module 2: Budget Appropriation \nA significant part of the financing for disaster response and recovery \nwill be channeled through the State budget. Appropriate provisions for \ndisasters before they occur can significantly reduce fiscal risks and greatly \nenhance a government’s ability to provide victims with aid immediately after \na disaster when they may need it most. Ex-ante budgeting for disasters \ncan boost savings, reduce risk exposure and promote aggregate fiscal \nstability. Budget frameworks that allow greater flexibility after disasters \nincrease government’s response capacity by allowing quick redeployment \nof expenditures across budget lines. The post-disaster redeployment \nof resources has to be done transparently and following clearly defined \nprocedures to maintain citizen’s trust. The following indicators are used \nto assess the extent to which a country’s national budget is responsive \nand flexible enough to finance timely post-disaster relief and recovery \noperations:\n Ȋ M2.1: Budget planning for disaster relief and recovery. This indicator examines \nthe extent to which various sources for financing disaster relief and recovery \n(including reserve funds, contingent spending arrangements, contingent loan \nfacilities, risk transfer instruments) are predetermined, programmed, and \nmanaged to optimize the government’s financial response capacity without \ncompromising fiscal balances or development objectives. 10"

Indicator M2.2 takes stock of the various means to supplement \nand/or reallocate approved appropriations across and within the budgets of \ngovernment ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) in response to a \ndisaster. The indicator assesses the limits on the extent and nature of any such \nadjustments. Approval times by government and other PFM actors, such as \nparliament, and the clarity of the reallocation procedures are also considered. Module 3: Financial Management Controls \nThe management of public resources in response to disasters should \nensure that stakeholders are held accountable for the way they use public \nresources and exercise authority. This module focuses on evaluating the \ncontrols that are in place to ensure that post-disaster relief and recovery \nfinancial resources are used as intended in a transparent manner. It assesses \nwhether there is: appropriate supervision of officers and separation of \nfinancial duties to mitigate the risk of corruption; adequate record keeping \nallowing for proper monitoring and audit; and sufficient information system \nresiliency. The following four indicators are used to assess Module 3: \n Ȋ M3.1: Post-disaster expenditure controls. This indicator examines the extent \nto which the segregation of duties, or other controls, are applied in the \nauthorization of expenditures, transaction processing, custody, and recording \nfunctions during post-disaster situations. An individual or small group of \nindividuals should not be able to initiate, approve, undertake, and review the \nsame action.

Module 4: Public Procurement \nTimely disaster response may require the procurement of goods and \nservices through expedited procedures. Such expedient procedures \nshould ensure adequate accountability, transparency, and overall value for \nmoney, considering quality, cost and time of delivery. Ideally, public finance \nlegislation reviewed under Module 1 should prescribe the public procurement \nprocedures that can be followed after a disaster.

The \nPD-PFM Review covers the broad policy and institutional framework and \nmore granular level processes. The review allows an assessor to quickly \ncollect data that describes how a Ministry of Finance operates in disaster \nsituations, highlighting potential weaknesses and strengths. Annex 1 \npresents a list of key interview questions and the different aspects of the \nPFM system that pertain to each question. Each of the indicators described \nabove has several dimensions. The indicators are assessed on a three-point \nscale based on existence of the function/process with the following scores: \nYes = 1, Partial = 0.5, or No = 0. The summary score is calculated by adding \ntogether the scores for each indicator and expressing the final score as \na percentage of the potential score if all indicators were scored as 1. The \nsummary score can be used to provide an overall assessment of the degree \nof integration of disaster response considerations across the PFM system. The extent to which disaster-response considerations are integrated into \nPFM functions are assessed in five categories. Ȋ Low (or no) Integration, an aggregate score of less than 25 percent, denotes \nthat a few PFM functions support post-disaster response and those which do \nhelp to accelerate response are likely to be incidental rather than part of a \ncoherent strategy. This may indicate a low level of awareness of post-disaster \nresponse as a functional imperative of the overall PFM system. Significant \nimprovements are needed to facilitate efficient and effective response to \ndisasters. Ȋ Basic Integration, an aggregate score of between 25 and 50 percent, \nindicates that disaster-response considerations are integrated in some key \nPFM functions. Some PFM processes carried out with the intent to expedite \nresponse to disasters, but this approach is not yet systematic. This category \nsignals that disaster response awareness is still limited. The PFM system \nwould benefit from further strengthening to facilitate response to disasters. 13"

A team of assessors reviews the “As-Is” state of preparedness against the \nlist of key interview questions and criteria outlined in Annex 1. Once these \npractices are documented, they are confirmed in Stage 2. Stage 2 — Country Visit  \nThe review team visits the country to map the PFM processes and practices \nthat facilitate response to disasters. Through discussions with government \nauthorities using Annex 1 as a guide, areas of strength and vulnerability \nare identified. The output of Stage 2 is a report of the results with \nrecommendations on ways to strengthen identified vulnerable PFM areas  \nStage 3 — Validation and Action Plan Development \nIn the final stage of the review, a validation exercise is conducted with key \nstakeholders to ensure that the findings of the PD-PFM Review are valid \nand credible. The team develops recommendations and works together \nwith the government to formulate a prioritized reform strategy to address \nthe key challenges identified in the prior two stages. All reports undergo \na robust internal quality enhancement review by the World Bank prior to \ndissemination.

Yet, the sector continues to face significant challenges related to unpredictable\nweather, soil degradation, pest outbreaks, and improper farming practices, all\ncontributing to variable and often declining crop yields. Traditional methods of\nyield prediction rely heavily on human intuition or simple statistical models,\nwhich fail to capture the complex interplay between environmental and biological\nfactors. This project aims to harness the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and\nMachine Learning (ML) to develop a robust, data-driven crop yield prediction\nsystem. By leveraging datasets that include meteorological, soil, and historical\nyield data, we implement and evaluate multiple machine learning models to\ndetermine the best-performing approach for accurate yield forecasting. The\nsystem is designed to be scalable, adaptable to different crop types and regions,\nand easily accessible through a web-based interface. This predictive solution has\nthe potential to empower farmers, agricultural experts, and policy makers by\nproviding timely insights and aiding in informed decision-making for better\nagricultural productivity."

This phase involves examining\nexisting agricultural forecasting methods, identifying limitations, understanding\nstakeholder needs, and defining system requirements. For this project, the\nprimary focus is on analyzing traditional and current approaches to crop yield\nprediction and evaluating how artificial intelligence can bridge the accuracy and\nusability gaps. The analysis helps justify the need for a new AI-enabled system\nby contrasting it with existing solutions and their drawbacks. 2.2 Problem Identification and Description\nAgriculture is inherently influenced by multiple, often unpredictable factors such\nas rainfall, temperature, soil conditions, pest outbreaks, and human intervention. Despite being vital, crop yield prediction has remained imprecise due to several\nchallenges:\n\nNon-linearity of agricultural data: Traditional statistical models assume\nlinear relationships, which often do not reflect the real-world interactions\namong variables. \nLimited regional coverage: Most existing systems are designed for a\nspecific region or crop, making them ineffective when scaled or\ngeneralized. \nManual dependency: Many yield estimation systems rely on manual data\nanalysis and expert intuition, which is both time-consuming and prone to\nhuman error. \nInadequate integration of data types: Yield depends on multiple types\nof data – meteorological, soil, historical yield, satellite imagery – yet\nexisting systems often work on limited datasets. \nLack of real-time prediction support: Systems generally operate on\nhistorical data and cannot adapt dynamically to new inputs such as sudden\nweather changes. \nDifficulty in interpretation for farmers: Many models are too complex\nfor non-expert end-users like smallholder farmers. This project addresses these limitations by proposing a machine learning–based\nsolution that learns from large, diverse datasets and produces real-time,"
