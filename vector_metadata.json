The Digital Economy Ministers issued a declaration, which noted that it is \nessential to continue the work on further understanding of the market impact of emerging \ntechnologies and new business models, like online platforms and the need to advance a fair, \npredictable, transparent, competitive and non-discriminatory business environment. 9. Recalling these discussions, we exchanged views on how to achieve an inclusive, sustainable, \nsafe, trustworthy and innovative society through digitalization. We share the notion of a human-\ncentered future society which is being promoted as Society 5.0 in Japan. Society 5.0 is a vision \nof human-centered future society promoted by the Japanese government to achieve an \nadvanced society, which realizes economic growth and solves social challenges, by advancing \ntowards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the increasing convergence of the \nphysical world and the virtual world. 10. Digitalization is expected to continue creating benefits for our economies and societies as a \nwhole. The benefits brought by increased productivity through the use of emerging technologies \nsuch as artificial intelligence (AI), fifth-generation mobile telecommunication technologies (5G), \nthe Internet of Things (IoT), Distributed Ledger Technologies (e.g. block chain) will empower all \nindividuals and firms by creating new opportunities, and generate new services and \nemployment, all of which can lead to greater well-being and further inclusiveness for individuals \nand firms. 11. While digitalization has tremendous potential to deliver benefits to society, it also raises certain \nconcerns. Digital divide should be addressed with a commitment to evidence-based policy \napproaches together with the efforts to improve the measurement of the digital economy that \nenable the widest possible adoption and use of innovative technology. We should come \ntogether to promote trust in the digital economy to harness the benefits brought by digitalization \nas well as to mitigate the associated challenges. 12. The G20 also reaffirms its commitment to fighting exploitation of the Internet for violent \nextremist and terrorist purposes, as well as promoting a free, open and secure internet, and \nencourages the digital industry to continue to work together with all stakeholders in fighting use \nof the Internet and social media for violent extremist and terrorist purposes, and addressing \ncontent that incites terrorist acts. 13."

Data Free Flow with Trust \n15. Reaffirming the commitments made in Hangzhou, Dusseldorf, and Salta, we share the \nunderstanding that digitalization gives us the opportunity to promote inclusive and sustainable \neconomic growth. Digitalization also promotes social and cultural progress and development, \nfosters innovation, and empowers individuals and businesses, including micro, small, and \nmedium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to benefit from emerging technologies and data. 16. Cross-border flow of data, information, ideas and knowledge generates higher productivity, \ngreater innovation, and improved sustainable development. At the same time, we recognize that \nthe free flow of data raises certain challenges. By continuing to address challenges related to \nprivacy, data protection, intellectual property rights, and security, we can further facilitate data \nfree flow and strengthen consumer and business trust. In order to build trust and facilitate the \nfree flow of data, it is necessary that legal frameworks both domestic and international should \nbe respected. Such data free flow with trust will harness the opportunities of the digital \neconomy. We will cooperate to encourage the interoperability of different frameworks, and we \naffirm the role of data for development. 3. Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (AI) \n17. Recognizing the efforts undertaken so far by all stakeholders in their respective roles including \ngovernments, international organizations, academia, civil society and the private sector, and \nmindful of how technology impacts society, the G20 endeavors to provide an enabling \nenvironment for human-centered AI that promotes innovation and investment, with a particular \nfocus on digital entrepreneurship, research and development, scaling up of startups in this area, \nand adoption of AI by MSMEs which face disproportionally higher costs to adopt AI. 18. We recognize that AI technologies can help promote inclusive economic growth, bring great \nbenefits to society, and empower individuals. The responsible development and use of AI can \nbe a driving force to help advance the SDGs and to realize a sustainable and inclusive society, \nmitigating risks to wider societal values. The benefits brought by the responsible use of AI can \nimprove the work environment and quality of life, and create potential for realizing a human-\ncentered future society with opportunities for everyone, including women and girls as well as \nvulnerable groups. 19."

This Annex includes \nthe following principles of “inclusive growth, sustainable development and well-being”, “human-\ncentered values and fairness”, “transparency and explainability”, “robustness, security and \nsafety” and “accountability”. The Annex also offers guidance for consideration by policy makers \nwith the purpose of maximizing and sharing the benefits from AI, while minimizing the risks and \nconcerns, with special attention to international cooperation and inclusion of developing \ncountries and underrepresented populations. 20. In pursuing human-centered AI, G20 members recognize the need to continue to promote the \nprotection of privacy and personal data consistent with applicable frameworks. The G20 also \nrecognizes the need to promote AI capacity building and skills development. We will each \ncontinue to strive for international cooperation and endeavor to work together with appropriate \nfora in areas such as research and development, policy development and information sharing \nthrough the G20 Repository of Digital Policies and other open and collaborative efforts. 4. Governance Innovation - Agile and Flexible Policy Approaches in the Digital Economy - \n21. We recognize that harnessing the full potential of emerging technologies would benefit from \nmore innovation enabling approaches to policy making than in the past. We will strive for \ninnovation-friendly policies to capitalize the potential of digital technologies and look to remove \nbarriers to innovation accordingly. 22. We recognize that various countries have already taken steps with the intention of making \npolicy approaches more flexible, holistic, and agile, for example through the use of regulatory \nsandboxes. Policies, regulations, or the removal of regulatory barriers can contribute to and \naccelerate economic growth, and inclusive development by developing countries as well as \nMSMEs. 23. We recognize that governance in the digital era needs to be not only innovation-friendly but also \ninnovative itself, while not losing legal certainty. Interoperable standards, frameworks and \nregulatory cooperation can help in this regard. International as well as national policy \nformulation with the involvement of all relevant stakeholders in their respective roles is \ninstrumental to address a wide range of societal challenges and facilitate discussion on how \ntechnology can be better incorporated into policy tools. 24.

These have a negative impact on digital innovations, and trust by consumers and businesses, \nand thus hinder us from taking full advantage of the benefits of digitalization. Security in the \ndigital economy is also important for governments in providing their services. 26. Along with the rapid expansion of emerging technologies, including IoT, the value of an ongoing \ndiscussion on security in the digital economy is growing. We, as G20 members, affirm the need \nto further work on these urgent challenges. We recognize the global aspect of security in the digital economy together with the need to \ndevelop localized and customized frameworks and methodologies. Industry-led and market-led \nglobal technical standards, developed based upon principles of openness, transparency, and \nconsensus help deliver interoperability. These promote trust, which is essential for enabling the \nbenefits of the global digital economy. 27. We recognize the need to raise awareness on the importance of actions to enhance security in \nthe digital economy. We also recognize the role played by stakeholders such as private sector, \nthe technical community and civil society, and relevant international organizations to further \ndiscuss those issues. We note relevant international organizations working on security in the \ndigital economy within their existing mandates and efforts in security in the digital economy. 6.

We agree \nthat expanding trade and investment will be important factors to promote future widespread \neconomic prosperity and sustainable growth. 41. We note that trade and investment growth slowed in 2018 and that this is contributing to a \nweaker global growth outlook for 2019-20 than previously projected. While growth is expected \nto increase in 2020, downside risks arising from the current trade environment could undermine \nthis growth. 42. We continued our dialogue to mitigate risks and enhance confidence among exporters and \ninvestors, as we committed to do in Mar del Plata last year. We affirmed the need to handle \ntrade tensions and to foster mutually beneficial trade relations. 43. We strive to realize a free, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent, predictable and stable trade and \ninvestment environment, to keep our markets open. 44. International trade is important for productivity, innovation, job creation and development. We \nrecognize the contributions that the WTO has made to this end. We agree that action is \nnecessary to improve the functioning of the WTO. We recognize our business community's call \nfor the G20 to continue supporting the multilateral trading system. 2.

We reaffirm that structural problems in some sectors can cause a negative impact, especially as \nthe global economy has become more integrated. We will strive to ensure a level playing field \nand foster an enabling business environment. 46. Many members affirm the need to strengthen international rules on industrial subsidies and \nwelcome ongoing international efforts to improve trade rules affecting agriculture. Many of us \nhighlighted agricultural subsidies and agricultural market access. 47.

There is recognition that the benefits of trade and investment have not been shared widely \nenough with all countries and all members of society, especially those who are vulnerable. We \nneed to enhance the benefits of trade and broaden participation. We also need to better \nunderstand the effects of trade and investment, better communicate their benefits to our \ncitizens, and address their challenges. 50. We should promote, facilitate and increase the participation of groups that have not benefitted \nsufficiently from international trade, such as women, youth and MSMEs, while assisting them to \nseize the opportunities of international trade. We will continue to seek to enable enhanced \nparticipation by developing countries and MSMEs in Global Value Chains in increasingly \nmeaningful ways. In this context, we recalled the discussion last year on key factors for G20 \ntrade and investment policy-making options to support the participation and increase value \naddition in agro-food Global Value Chains. 51. We take note of the “B20 Tokyo Summit Joint Recommendations: Society 5.0 for SDGs” as a \nvoice of the business sector, while recognizing different national views on these proposals. 52. We also take note of the adoption by the B20 of a “Business Voluntary Action Plan” which \nreflects views from the private sector and the intention of global businesses to strengthen \nefforts to jointly contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, through \nresponsible business conduct. 53. We shared information on business and policy examples that contribute to widespread and \nsustainable growth and inclusivity through trade and investment with the aim of learning from \neach other’s experiences, while acknowledging the different approaches of individual G20 \nMembers, and noted the importance of the idea of Sanpoyoshi - benefitting the seller, the \npurchaser and society. These examples will be publicly available. 4. WTO reform and Recent Developments in Bilateral and Regional Trade Agreements \n54. Building on the G20 Leaders’ declaration in Buenos Aires, we will work constructively with other \nWTO Members to undertake necessary WTO reform with a sense of urgency, including in the \nlead-up to the Twelfth WTO Ministerial Conference. 55. We recognize the importance of transparency of the WTO Members’ trade related policies. We \nnote ongoing initiatives on transparency and notifications with this purpose in mind. We confirm \nour commitment to fulfilling our existing notification obligations. 56."

We note the ongoing discussion under the Joint Statement Initiative on electronic commerce. 60. Participants in the respective Joint Statement Initiatives under the WTO welcome the ongoing \ndiscussion and confirm their commitment to achieve progress. 61. In order to share the benefits of digitalization worldwide, we recognize that there is a need to \nenhance investment in infrastructure focusing on ICT, including in developing countries, to \nfacilitate their participation in the digital economy. We also acknowledge the need for capacity \nbuilding for women, youth and MSMEs to benefit more from digitalization. To this end, we will \ncontinue our effort to harness and enhance the potential of trade and the digital economy. 62. We recognize the complementary roles of bilateral and regional free trade agreements that are \nWTO-consistent. 63. We agree that action is necessary regarding the functioning of the dispute settlement system \nconsistent with the rules as negotiated by the WTO Members. Ⅲ.Interface between Trade and the Digital Economy  \n64. We, the G20 Trade Ministers and Digital Economy Ministers, recognizing the growing impact of \ndigitalization on our societies and economies including in trade and commerce, reaffirmed the \nimportance of the interface between trade and the digital economy as stated in the Buenos \nAires Leaders’ declaration. We discussed related issues on the interface between trade and the \ndigital economy. 65. We exchanged views on various issues including the concept of data free flow with trust, WTO \ndiscussions on electronic commerce, and needs for capacity building, bearing in mind the \nimportance of ensuring that all countries are able to realize their opportunities. Discussions \nshould continue with a view to enhance the benefits of digitalization, which is transforming \nevery aspect of our economies and societies, and can contribute to economic growth, job \ncreation, inclusion, development and innovation. Ⅳ. Towards the Osaka Summit \n66. With a view to deepening G20 cooperation in the area of Trade and Digital Economy, we jointly \nrecommend our Leaders consider these important topics at the Osaka Summit."

Section 1: Principles for responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI \n \n1.1. Inclusive growth, sustainable development and well-being \nStakeholders should proactively engage in responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI in pursuit of \nbeneficial outcomes for people and the planet, such as augmenting human capabilities and \nenhancing creativity, advancing inclusion of underrepresented populations, reducing economic, \nsocial, gender and other inequalities, and protecting natural environments, thus invigorating \ninclusive growth, sustainable development and well-being. 1.2. Human-centered values and fairness \na) AI actors should respect the rule of law, human rights and democratic values, throughout the AI \nsystem lifecycle. These include freedom, dignity and autonomy, privacy and data protection, \nnon-discrimination and equality, diversity, fairness, social justice, and internationally recognized \nlabor rights. b) To this end, AI actors should implement mechanisms and safeguards, such as capacity for \nhuman determination, that are appropriate to the context and consistent with the state of art. 1.3. Transparency and explainability \nAI Actors should commit to transparency and responsible disclosure regarding AI systems. To this \nend, they should provide meaningful information, appropriate to the context, and consistent with the \nstate of art: \ni. to foster a general understanding of AI systems; \nii. to make stakeholders aware of their interactions with AI systems, including in the workplace; \niii. to enable those affected by an AI system to understand the outcome; and, \niv. to enable those adversely affected by an AI system to challenge its outcome based on plain \nand easy-to-understand information on the factors, and the logic that served as the basis for the \nprediction, recommendation or decision. 1.4. Robustness, security and safety \na) AI systems should be robust, secure and safe throughout their entire lifecycle so that, in \n                                                   \n2 This Annex draws from the OECD principles and recommendations."

Investing in AI research and development \na) Governments should consider long-term public investment, and encourage private investment, \nin research and development, including inter-disciplinary efforts, to spur innovation in \ntrustworthy AI that focus on challenging technical issues and on AI-related social, legal and \nethical implications and policy issues. b) Governments should also consider public investment and encourage private investment in \nopen datasets that are representative and respect privacy and data protection to support an \nenvironment for AI research and development that is free of inappropriate bias and to improve \ninteroperability and use of standards. 2.2. Fostering a digital ecosystem for AI \nGovernments should foster the development of, and access to, a digital ecosystem for trustworthy \nAI. Such an ecosystem includes in particular digital technologies and infrastructure, and \nmechanisms for sharing AI knowledge, as appropriate. In this regard, governments should consider \npromoting mechanisms, such as data trusts, to support the safe, fair, legal and ethical sharing of \ndata. 2.3 Shaping an enabling policy environment for AI \na) Governments should promote a policy environment that supports an agile transition from the \nresearch and development stage to the deployment and operation stage for trustworthy AI \nsystems. To this effect, they should consider using experimentation to provide a controlled \nenvironment in which AI systems can be tested, and scaled-up, as appropriate. b) Governments should review and adapt, as appropriate, their policy and regulatory frameworks \nand assessment mechanisms as they apply to AI systems to encourage innovation and \ncompetition for trustworthy AI. 2.4. Building human capacity and preparing for labor market transformation \na) Governments should work closely with stakeholders to prepare for the transformation of the \nworld of work and of society. They should empower people to effectively use and interact with \nAI systems across the breadth of applications, including by equipping them with the necessary \nskills. b) Governments should take steps, including through social dialogue, to ensure a fair transition for \nworkers as AI is deployed, such as through training programs along the working life, support for \nthose affected by displacement, and access to new opportunities in the labor market."
